# Global Road Accidents Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the analysis conducted on the Global Road Accidents Dataset. The primary goal of this project was to explore, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from the dataset using Excel. Below is a detailed description of the steps taken and the results achieved.

## Dataset Description
The Global Road Accidents Dataset contains information on road accidents from various regions worldwide. The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Accident severity
- Number of vehicles involved
- Number of casualties
- Accident location (city/country)
- Date and time of the accident
- Weather conditions
- Road surface conditions
- Additional relevant factors

## Objectives
The analysis was conducted with the following objectives:
1. To identify patterns and trends in global road accidents.
2. To understand the impact of various factors (e.g., weather, road conditions) on accident severity.
3. To derive actionable insights that could contribute to improving road safety.

## Analysis Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Checked for missing values**: Identified and addressed missing or incomplete data entries by using filters and conditional formatting.
- **Standardized data formatting**: Ensured consistency in date formats, text capitalization, and numerical values.
- **Removed duplicates**: Verified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics**: Calculated key metrics such as averages, totals, and percentages for accident severity, casualties, and other attributes.
- **Pivot tables**: Created pivot tables to analyze accidents by location, time, and contributing factors.
- **Visualizations**: Developed charts and graphs, including:
  - Bar charts for accident counts by severity.
  - Line charts to show trends over time.
  - Pie charts for distribution of accidents by weather conditions.

### 3. Trend Analysis
- **Geographical trends**: Identified regions with the highest and lowest accident rates.

### 4. Factor Impact Analysis
- **Weather conditions**: Assessed the correlation between adverse weather and accident severity.
- **Road surface conditions**: Compared accident rates on wet vs. dry roads.
- **Vehicle involvement**: Evaluated the relationship between the number of vehicles involved and casualties.

## Key Findings
1. **Peak accident times**: Most accidents occurred during rush hours (morning and evening).
2. **Weather influence**: Rainy and foggy conditions significantly increased accident severity.
3. **High-risk regions**: Urban areas had higher accident frequencies compared to rural areas, but rural accidents were often more severe.
4. **Road conditions**: Poor road surface conditions, such as potholes or wet roads, contributed to a higher number of accidents.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlighted critical data points and trends.
- **Charts**: Created bar, line, and pie charts for visualization.
- **Pivot Tables**: Summarized and organized data for better understanding.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the trends and factors affecting global road accidents. These findings can help policymakers, urban planners, and safety organizations design better strategies to reduce accidents and improve road safety.

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis to identify seasonal trends.
- Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Combine this dataset with additional data sources (e.g., traffic volume, population density) for more comprehensive insights.
